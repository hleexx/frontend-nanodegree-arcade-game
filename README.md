# Frogger Game

I am building an arcade game based on the popular game, "Frogger" with setup code from Udacity. This version is a clone of the basic game setup without any additional functionalities.

### Basic Functionality

In this game, there is a Player (you/user) and the Enemies (bugs). The player's goal is to reach the water without colliding into any of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up, and down using the arrow keys on your keyboard. The enemies move at varying speeds on the three paved stone lanes. If the player collides with any of the enemies, the player receives an alert and the game is reset with the player moving back to the starting square. To win the game, the player needs to reach the water without getting hit.
